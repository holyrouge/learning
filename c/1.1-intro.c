C programming is a compiled language
    This means that all syntax has to be legal in order to create an executable
    file
C is one of the oldest languages still used today
    Inspired numerous other languages (C++, C#, Java, etc.)
C is not object-oriented
C is statically typed (all variables are given a type at compile time)
C is not forgiving - simple mistakes are not told to you
C is dangerous but helps you learn the details and behind the scenes
C is valuable - still in demand, foundational concepts help everyone
C is hard - highest learning curve second to assembly
C is not TOO hard - once you get the hang of it
c is low-level - console apps and working with memory directly
C is a very popular language for system programmers or low-level programmers 
C has all the same progamming structures used in other languages
    - variables and data types
    - operators
    - control flow statements 
    - arrays and strings 
    - functions 
    - structs 
    - and some additional goodies: pointers and memory management
